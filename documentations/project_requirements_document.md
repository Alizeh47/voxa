# Voxa Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

Voxa is a real-time messaging web application built specifically for businesses, digital marketers, and content creators. The app is designed to improve communication by providing a sleek, modern platform for instant messaging, voice and video calls, media sharing, and actionable insights. By offering a clean interface and powerful collaboration tools, Voxa aims to streamline team interactions and enhance brand engagement. This project addresses the need for a professional yet user-friendly communication solution in the modern business landscape.

The platform is being built to help entrepreneurs and small to mid-sized businesses manage their communications more efficiently. Key objectives include delivering seamless real-time conversations, secure file and media sharing with a 100 MB limit per file, high quality voice and video integrations via third-party services (Twilio or Agora), and smart analytics for user engagement. Success for Voxa will be measured by improved collaboration among users, high engagement metrics, and positive feedback on usability and performance.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   A clean and minimalistic dashboard layout with a left-side navigation panel for easy access.
*   Real-time one-on-one and group chat capabilities with typing indicators, read receipts, and message reactions.
*   Media and file sharing with support for common formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF; MP4, MOV; MP3; PDF, DOCX) and a file size limit of 100 MB.
*   Voice and video call integration using a third-party service (Twilio or Agora), including screen sharing.
*   User authentication with multiple methods (email, phone, and popular social logins like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn).
*   Customizable user profiles with status indicators, profile pictures, and bios.
*   Advanced chat features such as pinned or starred messages, search bars with filters, and chat organization tabs (All, Unread, Favorites, Groups).
*   In-app alerts combined with web push notifications to keep users informed even when offline.
*   Integrations with third-party cloud services (Google Drive and Dropbox) that enable users to access and share files directly from their accounts.
*   A comprehensive administrative panel for managing users, moderating chats, overseeing content, and tracking analytics.
*   Customization options, including light/dark mode, adjustable fonts, and chat bubble styles.

### Out-of-Scope

*   Developing a native mobile app beyond the web platform (although multi-device synchronization is planned).
*   Building a custom solution for voice and video calls (the plan is to integrate proven third-party APIs).
*   Additional advanced features like AI-based personal assistants or chatbots beyond actionable insights and analytics.
*   Offline messaging capabilities that work without an active internet connection.
*   In-depth integration with additional third-party services except for those mentioned (Google Drive, Dropbox, Twilio/Agora).

## 3. User Flow

When a new user visits Voxa, they are greeted by a clean landing page that introduces the app and its key features. The user is prompted to sign up or log in using email, phone, or social login options (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn). Upon authentication, the user sets up a personalized profile by selecting a profile picture, writing a bio, and setting a status to indicate availability. The journey continues with the user entering their personalized dashboard, where a minimalistic design and a left-side navigation panel make it easy to find chats, contacts, and settings.

Once on the dashboard, users quickly see an overview of their recent conversations and notifications. They can start or join chats, use the search bar to filter conversations, and organize their messages using tabs for All, Unread, Favorites, and Groups. In any conversation, they benefit from clear indicators such as typing hints and read receipts, while having features like message pinning and editing at their fingertips. The user journey culminates in a seamless switch between text messaging, media sharing (including in-app image editing), and voice or video calling, thus providing a smooth and integrated experience across all communication needs.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   Voxa assumes the availability and consistent performance of third-party APIs (Twilio/Agora, Google Drive, Dropbox) throughout deployment.
*   There is an assumption that users will generally not exceed the file size limit of 100 MB, ensuring system efficiency.
*   The project is initially web-focused with a prompt for a desktop client; native mobile applications are not covered in this phase.
*   Localization and multi-language support are built in from the start to broaden the user base.
*   It is assumed that the users are familiar with modern web applications and expect a high-performance, secure, and easy-to-use messaging platform.
*   The design and technical decisions are based on current market trends and the need for secure, real-time communication for business users.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Third-Party API Dependencies**:

    *   Relying on Twilio/Agora for voice and video calls means any API rate limits or downtime could affect service quality. Mitigation includes caching mechanisms and fallback error messages.

*   **File Upload Restrictions**:

    *   The 100 MB limit per file must be enforced strictly; larger files may need alternative handling. Clear messaging and error handling will be important.

*   **Security Management**:

    *   Handling sensitive user data along with rapid real-time communication may increase the risk of security breaches. Regular security audits and compliance checks are essential.

*   **User Experience Consistency**:

    *   Achieving a seamless experience across all devices and handling real-time data updates may present synchronization challenges. Thorough frontend and backend testing is necessary.

*   **Localization**:

    *   Multi-language support increases complexity in UI/UX design and requires ongoing maintenance for translations and regional compliance.

*   **Administrative Oversight**:

    *   The administrative panel functionality, including user management and content moderation, must balance control with privacy. Clear policies and scalable backend support are needed to mitigate potential abuse.
